First, complete the main quests, world quests, and side quests!

Follow the instructions in the game to complete the main quests.

Use the world quests and side quests to explore the region and learn more about its history and culture.

Be sure to complete all of the quests before moving on to the next step.

The difficulty of this region is very high, so be sure to use your brain and think carefully.

If you get stuck, you can always refer to the game's instructions or online guides.

The last step is to find the Holy Relics.

The Holy Relics are hidden throughout the region, so you will need to explore carefully to find them.

Once you have found all of the Holy Relics, you will be able to complete the Sumeru region and unlock the next one.
