Instructions for using the Genshin Impact "Luminous Mirage" treasure chest and gift certificate collection script:

Set the script to run automatically. Make sure to enable "Kill" and "Pickup" (pickup distance is recommended to be no less than 40 meters).
Once the script has finished collecting treasure chests and gift certificates, manually complete the challenge points.
After completing the treasure chests, gift certificates, and challenges, you can complete the puzzle treasure chests and other points as needed. Do this until you have 270 gift certificates.
Once you have 270 gift certificates, you can use the activity item to mark the remaining treasure chests. Then, you can complete them one by one.
Notes:

You need to have unlocked all three regions before using this script.
